# machine-learning
- This project is an implementaiton for an MSc thesis work entitled " Labor and delivery complication prediction using machine learning algorithms "
- KNN, SVM, Logistic regression and Random forest algorithms are implemeted to predict labor and delivery complication using antenatal care dataset.
- Model build with random forest scored higher performance to predict labor and delivery complication.
